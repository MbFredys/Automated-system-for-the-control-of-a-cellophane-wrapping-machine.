# Automated-system-for-the-control-of-a-cellophane-wrapping-machine.

Summary:
In this diploma thesis, a proposal for modernizing the Sollas 20 cellophane wrapping machine of the International Cuban Tobacco Factory S.A. (ICT, S.A.) is developed. Its operation is studied, and the technological means that compose it are described. In addition, a proposal for new instrumentation is made to increase its safety, control, and efficiency.

The corresponding mathematical model for the temperature variation process in the sealers is obtained using identification techniques, and the corresponding control system is designed. The sequential logic of the machine is programmed in a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), and a screen is added as a Human-Machine Interface (HMI).

The new electrical panel of the machine is designed, as well as the new electrical diagrams that describe it. Different programs are used for the configuration of the devices used, as well as for the development, programming, and parameterization of the applications, including MatlabÂ®, SoMove, TiaPortal, Sopas Engineer, and SolidWorks."
