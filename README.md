# Automated-system-for-the-control-of-a-cellophane-wrapping-machine.

This is the work developed by my colleague Alejandro PÃ©rez Baez and me in pursuit of the degree of Automation Engineer in 2017. It is an automated design for the control of the SOLLAS 20 cellophane wrapping machine at the Internacional Cubana de Tabaco S.A. factory.

****Chapter I**** - In this chapter, a study of the background of the control of cellophane wrapping machines is presented, as well as the current status of the machine to be modernized, the Sollas 20.

****Chapter II**** - Here, the current instrumentation used is analyzed and new proposals for technological means are made for the Sollas 20 cellophane wrapping machine.

****Chapter III**** -For this chapter, the design of the temperature control system that allows for the sealing of the packages in the machine was left.

****Chapter IV**** - Here, the programming logic followed is shown, as well as the configuration of the PLC and HMI. The design of the new electrical diagram and panel is also presented.
